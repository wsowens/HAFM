#Adulting Financial Manager: Updating an old project  
This project is based on code written shortly after I learned Java. It's not particularly great.
My main intent with this project is to update and fix the bugs I left.

In the process of making everything much more object-oriented, including the way Transaction interacts with Category. I am in the process of moving the functionality over to "apply()" and "unapply()". For the older functionality, look at the commit before this, or look at the addCategory(category) call I commented out in the Transaction constructor.
